## Key Tips for FAANG Interviews

1. **Master BFS & DFS first** - They're the foundation for 70% of graph problems
2. **Practice graph construction** - Many problems require building the graph from input
3. **Know time/space complexity** - Be able to explain O(V+E) for traversal
4. **Multiple approaches** - Some problems can be solved with BFS, DFS, or Union-Find
5. **Edge cases:** Empty graphs, disconnected components, self-loops, duplicate edges
6. **Communication:** Explain your approach before coding, discuss tradeoffs
